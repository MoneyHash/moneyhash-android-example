## Usage

To start the payment flow you need to get the payment id from your backend and send it as parameter with the environment (staging or production) and then start the flow

1- Add PaymentActivity to AndroidManifest.xml
```xml
<activity android:name="com.moneyhash.sdk.android.PaymentActivity" />
```

2- setup the activity result contract
```kotlin
    private val paymentResultContract =
        registerForActivityResult(PaymentResultContract()) { result ->
            if(result != null) {
                when(result){
                    is PaymentStatus.Error -> {
                        tv.text = result.errors.joinToString()
                    }
                    is PaymentStatus.Failed -> {
                        tv.text = "Failed"
                    }
                    is PaymentStatus.RequireExtraAction -> {
                        tv.text = result.actions.joinToString()
                    }
                    is PaymentStatus.Success -> {
                        tv.text = "Success"
                    }
                    is PaymentStatus.Unknown -> {
                        tv.text = "Unknown"
                    }
                    is PaymentStatus.Cancelled -> {
                        tv.text = "Cancelled"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
```

3- setup the target environment
```kotlin
MoneyHash.INSTANCE.setEnvironment(MoneyHashEnvironment.STAGING)
```

4- start the payment flow
```kotlin
MoneyHash.INSTANCE.start(paymentId, paymentResultContract)
```
